### It seems that even the copyrights provided by Fossology are somewhat contradictory.

What needs to be done
* I need to agree on a structure for all contradictory copyrights so that the data I'm using to train Machine Learning models is usable and my results are meaningful.
* If something is contradictory - I'll always mark it as a copyright and then human intervention will make the final choice.
  - Potentially, any text with 'copyright notice' in it will be considered a copyright - depends on how good my models are at differentiating them and on what my mentors will tell me.
  - Ask about 'copyright interest' (I did so last week but I'd like to be sure and if unsure I'll also consider all of them as copyrights - just to be safe).

* Write some code to detect if text is not english (whether it's general text or just the name of the person), and classify that automatically as either 0 or a different class for ambigiouties
*
